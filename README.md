## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

This is the first paragraph I shall write in GitBook

## What a great day!

### What a great day!

#### What a great day!

In the meantime I shall continue to write in a jolly normal form.  

How about pasting stuff in?

1000 Yards is the prequel novella \(around 20,000 words\) in the John Milton series. If you asked me to give a Hollywood pitch for the books, I'd say they were about a rōnin. A man who has no master save his guilt, who is trying to atone for his past sins by helping others. A reader once suggested to me that Milton is like James Bond, only if Bond was an alcoholic with a conscience \(until we agreed that Bond is probably an alcoholic, too, but that’s another thing\). I used to watch the CBS series The Equalizer when I was younger, and there is definitely a little of Robert McCall in Milton, too.
